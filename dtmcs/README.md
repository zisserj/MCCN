### dtmcs

This folder contains the models, mostly taken [from here](https://github.com/prismmodelchecker/prism-benchmarks/tree/master/models/dtmcs) with added labels, as well as the scripts used to generate and process the results.

`robot` contains the script used to generate the prism models for that scenario.

The raw results of the experiments can be found in `timing_all.csv`.
